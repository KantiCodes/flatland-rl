# Moving Flatland 2 code to Flatland 3 - Common changes

## 1. Line Generators

`schedule_generators` are now renamed to `line_generators`

This is because Flatland 2 had no concept of a timetable for allowed departures of expected arrival times. `line_generators` now generate the data that `schedule_generators` used to (start-end station pairs for agents).

If your code used `sparse_schedule_generator`, replace it with `sparse_line_generator`, the behaviour slightly varies, but it should be similar for the most high level code.

## 2. Max rail pairs in city

`sparse_rail_generator` has an input parameter `max_rails_in_city` replaced with `max_rail_pairs_in_city`. You can replace the original input number that was being used by dividing it by 2. This is to ensure every city has a minimum of 2 rails which we keep as a constraint for balancing inflow and outflow of the trains.

---

## 3. Removal of `random` and `complex` generator classes

The genrator classes `complex_rail_generator`, `complex_schedule_genrator`, `random_rail_generator`, `random_schedule_generator` are now deprecated and removed from the environment. Please use `sparse_rail_generator` and `sparse_line_generator` instead.

---

## 4. Waiting Status

Flatland 3 introduces a `WAITING` status for every train, in which all actions will be ignored if the elapsed timesteps is less than the train's earliest departure. 

--- 

## 5. Safe minimum env size is 30x30
While its possible to generate smaller environments for exploration and understanding, we recommend using 30x30 as the minimum size to satisfy new constrains on the rail generation.
